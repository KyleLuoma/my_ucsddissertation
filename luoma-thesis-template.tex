I dedicate this dissertation to my loving wife Michelle who has shown nothing but love and support throughout my academic journey.

To my sons Constantine and Conrad, may this research in some small way improve the future that belongs to you.

and to my parents \emph{Debbie} the English teacher, and \emph{Jack} the Engineer whos examples and willingness to spend long days and nights teaching and shaping me directly contributed to an excellent life;

and to the memory of my good friend \emph{Ethan Clark}, with whom I grew up in the shadow of the Silicon Valley, and whose passion for all things computers prompted my first steps toward a lifetime of exploration in the field of computing.

\noindent Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for
writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve
his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and
often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a
good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.

\begin{preface}
Almost nothing is said in the manual about the preface. There is no
indication about how it is to be typeset. Given that, one is forced to
simply typeset it and hope it is accepted. It is, however, optional
and may be omitted.

\begin{acknowledgements}
I would like to acknowledge Professor Arun Kumar for his support as the
chair of my committee. Through multiple drafts and many long nights,
his guidance has proved to be invaluable.

I would also like to acknowledge the ``Smith Clan'' of lab~28, without
whom my research would have no doubt taken fives times as long. It is
their support that helped me in an immeasureable way.

The introduction section contains material from ``An Overview of Human-Database Interaction Methods'' by Kyle Luoma, written to satisfy the UCSD Computer Science Ph.D. research exam requirement. The dissertation author was the sole investigator and author of this paper.

Chapter 2, contains material from ``SNAILS: Schema Naming Assessments for Improved LLM-based SQL Inference'' by Kyle Luoma, and Arun Kumar, which appears in Proceedings of the 2025 International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD'25). The dissertation author was the primary investigator and author of this paper.

Chapter 3, contains material from ``SKALPEL: Schema Knowledge Adjustments for LLM NL-to-SQL Performance Enhancements for Large Databases'' by Kyle Luoma, and Arun Kumar, which has been submitted for publication of the material. The dissertation author was the primary investigator and author of this material.

The Abstract begins here. The abstract is limited to 350 words for a
doctoral dissertation. It should consist of a short statement of the
problem, a brief explanation of the methods and procedures employed in
generating the data, and a condensed summary of the findings of the
study. The abstract may continute onto a second page if necessary. The
text of the abstract must be double spaced.
